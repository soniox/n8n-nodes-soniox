## Overview

Soniox Speech-to-Text AI turns audio into highly accurate text. Paired with n8n, you can build powerful automation workflows that transcribe audio from any source.

Use the Soniox node in your n8n workflows to:

- Transcribe audio files uploaded to cloud storage
- Process voice messages from messaging platforms
- Build automated transcription pipelines at scale
- Combine speech-to-text with other n8n integrations

All with enterprise-grade accuracy.

---

## Getting started

To use Soniox with n8n, you'll need:

- An [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- A [Soniox account](https://console.soniox.com/) with an API key

---

## Installation

Install the Soniox community node from the n8n interface:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**
2. Click **Install a community node**
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-soniox`
4. Click **Install**

Alternatively, install via npm in your self-hosted n8n instance:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-soniox
```

---

## Credentials

The Soniox node requires an API key to authenticate.

### Get your API key

1. Sign in to the [Soniox Console](https://console.soniox.com/)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Create a new key or copy an existing one

### Add credentials in n8n

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** > **Add Credential**
2. Search for **Soniox API**
3. Enter your API key
4. Click **Save**

The credentials will be tested automatically. If successful, you're ready to use the Soniox node.

---

## Operations

The Soniox node supports three operations:

### Create transcription

Creates a new transcription job from an audio source. You can choose to wait for completion or receive results asynchronously via webhook.

**Audio sources:**

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Binary File | Upload audio from a previous node (e.g., HTTP Request, Read Binary File) |
| Audio URL | Provide a publicly accessible URL to the audio file |
| File ID | Use a file previously uploaded to Soniox |

### Get results

Retrieves the status and transcript for an existing transcription job. Use this when processing transcriptions asynchronously.

### Delete

Deletes a transcription and its associated file from Soniox. Simply provide the transcription ID — the node automatically fetches the file ID and deletes both resources. Use this to clean up after async workflows.

---

## Basic usage

### Transcribe from URL

The simplest way to transcribe audio is from a public URL:

1. Add the **Soniox** node to your workflow
2. Select **Create** operation
3. Set **Audio Source** to **Audio URL**
4. Enter the URL to your audio file
5. Execute the workflow

The node will wait for the transcription to complete and return the full transcript.

### Transcribe from binary data

To transcribe audio from another node (like HTTP Request or Read Binary File):

1. Connect the source node to the Soniox node
2. Select **Create** operation
3. Set **Audio Source** to **Binary File**
4. Set **Binary Property Name** to the property containing your audio (default: `data`)
5. Execute the workflow

---

## Advanced usage

### Language hints

The model automatically detects and transcribes any supported language. It also handles multilingual audio, even when multiple languages appear within the same conversation.

If you know which languages are likely to be spoken, you can provide language hints to improve accuracy:

1. In the Soniox node, find **Language Hints**
2. Click **Add Language**
3. Enter the language code (e.g., `en`, `es`, `fr`)
4. Repeat for additional languages

Enable **Language Hints Strict** to treat hints as constraints — the model will only transcribe in the specified languages.

See [list of supported languages](/stt/concepts/supported-languages) for all available language codes.

Learn more about [language hints](/stt/concepts/language-hints).

### Speaker diarization

Enable **Enable Speaker Diarization** to identify and separate different speakers in the audio. The transcript will include speaker labels for each segment.

### Language identification

Enable **Enable Language Identification** to include detected language information in the transcript output.

### Customization with context

Provide context to help the model better understand domain-specific terminology, names, or phrases.

**Simple text context:**

1. Set **Context Mode** to **Text**
2. Enter relevant terms or phrases in the **Context Text** field

```
Celebrex, Zyrtec, Xanax, Prilosec, Amoxicillin
```

**Structured JSON context:**

For more control, use structured context:

1. Set **Context Mode** to **Structured JSON**
2. Enter a JSON object in the **Context JSON** field

```json
{
  "general": [
    {"key": "domain", "value": "Healthcare"}
  ],
  "text": "Medical consultation recording",
  "terms": ["Celebrex", "Zyrtec", "Xanax"],
  "translation_terms": [
    {"source": "Dr. Smith", "target": "Dr. Smith"}
  ]
}
```

Learn more about [customizing with context](/stt/concepts/context).

### Translation

Soniox can translate the transcript to another language during transcription.

**One-way translation:**

Translate the transcript to a single target language:

1. Set **Translation Type** to **One Way**
2. Enter the **Target Language** code (e.g., `es` for Spanish)

**Two-way translation:**

For conversations between speakers of two languages, translate each speaker to the other's language:

1. Set **Translation Type** to **Two Way**
2. Enter **Language A** (e.g., `en`)
3. Enter **Language B** (e.g., `es`)

---

## Async processing with webhooks

For long audio files or high-volume processing, you can use webhooks instead of waiting for completion:

1. Set **Wait for Completion** to **false**
2. Enter your **Webhook URL**
3. Optionally set **Webhook Auth Header Name** and **Webhook Auth Header Value** for authentication

The node will immediately return the transcription ID and file ID (if a binary file was uploaded). Soniox will send the results to your webhook when processing completes.

To fetch results later, use the **Get Results** operation with the transcription ID.

---

## Cleanup and resource management

When you upload binary files, Soniox stores them temporarily. To avoid accumulating unused files, use the cleanup features:

### Automatic cleanup (recommended)

When **Wait for Completion** is enabled, the **Auto Delete** option is available (enabled by default).

When enabled, the node automatically deletes:
- The **transcription** — always deleted regardless of audio source
- The **uploaded file** — only deleted when using Binary File as the audio source (since that's when a file is uploaded)

This keeps your Soniox account clean without extra workflow steps.

### Manual cleanup

For async workflows (when not waiting for completion), use the **Delete** operation to clean up after processing:

1. Add a new **Soniox** node after receiving the webhook callback
2. Select **Delete** operation
3. Enter the **Transcription ID**
4. Execute

The Delete operation automatically fetches the transcription details to find the associated file ID, then deletes both the transcription and its file (if one exists).

**Example async cleanup workflow:**

1. **Soniox** (Create) — Upload file, don't wait, returns `id` (transcription ID)
2. **Webhook** trigger — Receives completion callback from Soniox
3. Process the transcript as needed
4. **Soniox** (Delete) — Clean up using the transcription ID from step 1

---

## Output options

### Output mode

Choose what data to return when the transcription completes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Full Response | Returns the complete transcript with all metadata, timestamps, and speaker information |
| Text Only | Returns only the transcribed text as a simple string |

### Polling settings

When **Wait for Completion** is enabled, you can configure:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Poll Interval (Sec) | 1 | How often to check for completion |
| Max Wait (Sec) | 300 | Maximum time to wait before timing out |

---

## Example workflows

### Transcribe uploaded files

Combine with the **Webhook** trigger to transcribe files uploaded via HTTP:

1. **Webhook** node receives the audio file
2. **Soniox** node transcribes the binary data
3. **Respond to Webhook** returns the transcript

### Process files from cloud storage

Transcribe audio files from Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3:

1. **Google Drive** / **Dropbox** / **S3** node downloads the file
2. **Soniox** node transcribes the binary data
3. **Google Sheets** / **Notion** / **Airtable** stores the results

### Async batch processing

Process multiple files without blocking:

1. **Loop Over Items** iterates through audio files
2. **Soniox** (Create) creates transcriptions with webhooks (Wait for Completion = false)
3. Separate workflow with **Webhook** trigger receives completed transcriptions
4. **Soniox** (Delete) cleans up the transcription and file after processing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication errors

If you see authentication errors:

- Verify your API key is correct in the Soniox credentials
- Check that your Soniox account is active
- Ensure you have sufficient credits

### Timeout errors

If transcriptions timeout:

- Increase the **Max Wait (Sec)** value
- Use async processing with webhooks for long files
- Check that your audio file is valid and not corrupted

### Unsupported format errors

Soniox supports most common audio formats including WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG, and more. If you encounter format errors:

- Ensure the file is a valid audio file
- Try converting to a standard format like WAV or MP3
